# Introduction

Periodic vegetation patterns (PVP) arise from the interplay between 
forces that drive the growth and mortality of plants. Inter-plant 
competetion for resources, in particular water, can lead to the 
formation of PVP.

Arid and semi-arid ecosystems may be under threat due to changing
precipitation dynamics driven by macroscopic changes in climate. These
regions disiplay some noteable examples of PVP, for example the "tiger
bush" in West Africa.

The mophology of the periodic pattern has been suggested to be 
linked to the resiliance of the ecosystem. Using remote sensing 
techniques,  vegetation patterns in these regions can be studied, 
and an analysis of the resiliance of the ecosystem can be performed.

This package implements functionality to download and process data
from Google Earth Engine, in the context of performing such a resiliance
analysis.

Google Earth Engine Editor scripts are also provided to help 
researchers discover locations of ecosystems which may be in
decline.
