# monitoring-ecosystem-resilience
Repository for mini-projects in the Data science for Sustainable development project.

Currently the focus of code in this repository is understanding vegetation patterns in semi-arid environments.  There are two subdirectories:

## patterns

This is a simple mathematical model for generating patterns of vegetation on a grid, and evolving them through time as the amount of water varies. 
The original code was in Matlab, and this has been translated into R and Python here.  For further details see the README in that directory.

## gee

This directory contains scripts and utilities for interacting with *Google Earth Engine*, to analyse satellite imagery of these semi-arid regions.
See the README in that directory for further details and instructions.
